        "Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, storing, and retrieving data in a computer. They provide a way to manage large amounts of data efficiently and are fundamental to computer science and programming. Data structures can be classified into two main categories: primitive and non-primitive.\n",

        "Efficiency: Different data structures offer different ways to store and access data. Choosing the right data structure can significantly improve the efficiency of algorithms, affecting both time and space complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Organization: Data structures help organize data in a way that makes it easier to manage and manipulate. This organization is crucial for tasks such as searching, sorting, and updating data.\n",

        "Reusability: Well-defined data structures can be reused across different programs and applications, promoting code modularity and reducing redundancy.\n",

        "2. Syntax\n",
        "Lists: Lists are defined using square brackets []\n",
        "Tuples: Tuples are defined using parentheses ().\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Performance\n",
        "Lists: Because lists are mutable, they have a bit more overhead in terms of memory and performance. Operations that modify a list can be slower than similar operations on a tuple.\n",

        "Tuples: Tuples are generally faster than lists for iteration and access because of their immutability. They require less memory and can be more efficient in terms of performance.\n",

        "Lists: Lists are typically used when you need a collection of items that may change over time. They are suitable for scenarios where you need to add, remove, or modify elements frequently.\n",

        "\n",
        "Dictionaries in Python are a built-in data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. They are also known as associative arrays or hash maps in other programming languages. Here’s a detailed description of how dictionaries store data:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Key-Value Pairs\n",
        "Structure: A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique within the dictionary and is used to access its corresponding values\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Hashing\n",
        "Hash Function: Internally, dictionaries use a hash function to compute a hash value for each key. This hash value determines the index at which the corresponding value is stored in memory. The hash function takes the key as input and returns a fixed-size string of bytes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Efficiency: The use of hashing allows for average-case constant time complexity (O(1)) for lookups, insertions, and deletions. This means that accessing a value by its key is generally very fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Handling Collisions\n",
        "Collisions: A collision occurs when two different keys produce the same hash value. To handle collisions, Python dictionaries use a technique called open addressing or chaining.\n",
        "\n",
        "Open Addressing: If a collision occurs, the dictionary will look for the next available slot in the array to store the new key-value pair.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chaining: Alternatively, each index in the dictionary can store a list (or another data structure) of key-value pairs that hash to the same index. This way, multiple pairs can coexist at the same index.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Dynamic Resizing\n",
        "Growth: When a dictionary reaches a certain load factor (the ratio of the number of entries to the size of the underlying array), it automatically resizes itself to maintain efficient performance. This involves creating a new, larger array and rehashing all existing key-value pairs into the new array.\n",
        "5. Order of Elements\n",
        "Insertion Order: As of Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain the insertion order of keys. This means that when you iterate over a dictionary, the items will be returned in the order they were added.\n",
        "6. Mutability\n",
        "Mutable: Dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can add, remove, or change key-value pairs after the dictionary has been created.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Performance for Membership Testing\n",
        "Faster Lookups: Sets provide average-case constant time complexity (O(1)) for membership testing (checking if an item is in the set) due to their underlying hash table implementation. In contrast, lists have linear time complexity (O(n)) for membership testing because they require iterating through the elements.\n",

        "4. Performance for Additions and Removals\n",

        "1. Memory Efficiency:\n",
        "\n",
        "Reusability: When a string is created, Python can optimize memory usage by reusing existing string objects. If strings were mutable, every modification would require creating a new string object, leading to increased memory consumption and fragmentation.\n",
        "Interning: Python employs a technique called string interning, where identical string literals are stored only once in memory. This is possible because strings are immutable. If strings could be changed, interning would be much more complex and less efficient.\n",
        "2. Performance:\n",
        "Faster Access: Immutable objects can be accessed more quickly because their memory address does not change. This can lead to performance improvements in certain operations, especially when strings are used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets.\n",
        "Optimized Operations: Many string operations can be optimized by the Python interpreter because it knows that the string will not change. For example, concatenation and slicing can be implemented more efficiently.\n",

        "Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets because they are hashable (as long as they contain only hashable elements).
